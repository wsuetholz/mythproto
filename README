DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A relatively simple to use Python module that speaks the mythtv protocol.

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - A recent Python. Tested with 2.5, but older versions may work as well
 - MythTV backend to connect to

INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Copy myth/ to python's site-packages directory
 - Change the target address in test.py
 - Run test.py
 - Type 'help' for a list of commands

NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - This is NOT a complete protocol implementation, but new commands should be
   relatively easy to add.
 - Only protocol version 31 is supported... The code can probably be adapted to
   newer versions by updating the ProgramInfo object in myth.types to match the
   programinfo struct in the mythtv codebase.

TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideally, this package should be updated to work with newer versions of the
mythtv protocol, but the mythtv devs have started working on replacing the QT
serialization based protocol with an XML based protocol, in order to make it
more flexible and easier to use by third-party applications, negating the need
for this library.
